Scenario Start: How a user accesses the website

A user opens their browser and types www.foobar.com
.

The browser asks the DNS servers: “What is the IP of www.foobar.com?”

DNS returns 8.8.8.8.

The user’s device now sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to 8.8.8.8, which is the IP of our server.

The server receives the request and processes it using:

Nginx (web server)

Application server + code base

MySQL database

The final HTML response is sent back to the user’s browser.

Infrastructure Components
1. Domain name: foobar.com

A domain name is a human-readable address that maps to an IP.

Its job: help users reach the website easily without remembering IP numbers.

2. DNS Record (www.foobar.com
)

The www record is a CNAME or A record.

Here, because it points directly to an IP (8.8.8.8), it is an A record.

3. The Server (IP: 8.8.8.8)

A server is a powerful computer that runs software to deliver websites to users.

On this one server we host everything:

Web server (Nginx)

Application server

Application code

MySQL database

Software Roles Inside the Server
4. Web Server (Nginx)

First component to receive user requests.

Handles:

HTTP/HTTPS traffic

Static files (CSS, images, JS)

Reverse proxying to the application server

5. Application Server

Runs the backend code (Python, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, etc.).

Handles business logic:

Authentication

Processing forms

Managing sessions

Preparing dynamic content

6. Application Files (Code Base)

Your website’s backend and frontend code.

It is executed by the application server.

7. Database (MySQL)

Stores:

Users

Posts

Orders

Any data the app needs

Application communicates with MySQL using SQL queries.

Communication Between Server & User

The server uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols to send responses to the user’s computer.

The network connection is through TCP/IP.

Problems / Issues with This Infrastructure
1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

If the server crashes, the entire website goes offline.

All components are on one machine → one failure breaks everything.

2. Downtime During Maintenance

Restarting:

Nginx

Application server

MySQL

Or deploying new code

Causes temporary downtime.

3. Cannot Scale With High Traffic

All traffic goes to one server.

If traffic increases:

CPU becomes overloaded

RAM becomes full

MySQL slows down

There is no load balancer, no replication.
