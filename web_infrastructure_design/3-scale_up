3. Scale Up – Infrastructure Explanation

When scaling up a simple web infrastructure, we add new servers and separate components to improve reliability, performance, and security. Below is the required setup and why each element is added.

🖥️ 1. Add 1 More Server

We add another server because:

It increases capacity, so the system can handle more users.

It provides redundancy. If one server fails, the other one can still serve traffic.

It helps distribute workload instead of putting all pressure on one machine.

🔀 2. Add a Load Balancer (HAProxy) and Configure It as a Cluster

We set up two HAProxy load balancers working as a cluster.

Why we add this:

To distribute the traffic between servers.

To avoid overload on a single server.

A load balancer cluster gives high availability:

If one load balancer goes down, the second one automatically continues working.

It improves the overall reliability of the infrastructure.

📂 3. Split Components Into Their Own Servers

We separate the architecture into:

Web server (Nginx/Apache)

Application server (Flask, Django, Node.js, etc.)

Database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB)

Why we do this:

Web Server

Handles static files (HTML, CSS, images) efficiently.

Improves performance by offloading static traffic from the application server.

Application Server

Runs backend logic.

Separation improves security and makes debugging easier.

Allows scaling backend services independently.

Database Server

Stores persistent data safely.

Isolation improves data security.

Allows independent scaling and backup without affecting other layers.

🧠 Summary: Why This Infrastructure is Better
Component	Why It Was Added
Additional Server	Higher capacity + redundancy
HAProxy Load Balancer (Cluster)	Traffic distribution + high availability
Web Server	Better handling of static resources
Application Server	Efficient backend processing
Database Server	Data safety + isolated scaling

This infrastructure supports scalability, fault tolerance, security, and better performance, which are the core goals of modern web systems.
